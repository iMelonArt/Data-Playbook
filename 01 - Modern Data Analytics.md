# Modern Data Analytics



# Data warehouse vs Data Lakehouse & Data Lake

A **data warehouse** is a structured repository optimized for fast querying and analysis of organized data, primarily used for business intelligence.

A **data lake** stores vast amounts of raw, unstructured data from various sources, providing flexibility for future data processing and analysis.

A **data lakehouse** combines elements of both data warehouses and data lakes, offering structured data management with the flexibility of handling unstructured data for comprehensive analytics. For instance, a lakehouse such as Microsoft synapse () is a collection of files, folders, and tables that represent a database over a data lake used by the Apache Spark engine and SQL engine for big data processing.



# Data warehouse
A data warehouse is an enterprise system used for the analysis and reporting of structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources, such as point-of-sale transactions, marketing automation, customer relationship management, and more.
