# Business continuity disaster recovery (BCDR)

Business continuity disaster recovery (BCDR) refers to a process that helps organizations return to normal business operations if a disaster happens. While business continuity and disaster recovery are closely related, they describe two subtly different approaches to crisis management that businesses can take.

The main difference is that BCPs are proactive, aiming to maintain operations before, during and right after a disaster. On the other hand, DRPs are reactive, focusing on how to respond and recover from an incident. This distinction should guide the creation of your BCDR strategy, with BCPs focusing on critical processes and roles, and DRPs on recovery actions post-incident. 

Both processes depend heavily on two critical components: recovery time objective and recovery point objective.

## Recovery time objective (RTO)

RTO refers to the amount of time it takes to restore business processes after an unplanned incident. Establishing a reasonable RTO is one of the first things businesses need do when they’re creating their DRP.

## Recovery point objective (RPO)

Your business’ RPO is the amount of data it can afford to lose in a disaster and still recover. Since data protection is a core capability of many modern enterprises, some constantly copy data to a remote data center to ensure continuity in case of a massive breach. Others set an RPO of a few minutes—or even hours—for them to recover business data from a backup system, so they know they are able to recover from whatever they've lost during that time.
